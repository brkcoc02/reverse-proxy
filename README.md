# Node.js Reverse Proxy Service

This lightweight Node.js application functions as a reverse proxy, serving as the public-facing interface to route requests to a target service. It effectively masks the target service's IP, aiding in bypassing IP-based restrictions.

## Features

- **Efficient Request Routing**: Forwards incoming HTTP requests to the designated backend service.
- **IP Obfuscation**: Conceals the actual IP address of the target service, enhancing accessibility.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, ensuring swift and reliable performance.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brkcoc02/reverse-proxy-service.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd reverse-proxy-service
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

You can configure the application using either environment variables or a .env file:

### Option 1: Direct Environment Variables

Define the following environment variables to configure the application:
- `TARGET_URL`: The URL of the target service to which requests will be proxied.
- `PORT`: The port number on which the proxy server will listen.

For example, in a Unix-based environment:
```bash
export TARGET_URL='http://your-target-service.com'
export PORT=3000
```

### Option 2: Using .env File (For Local Development)

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory
2. Add your configuration:
   ```
   TARGET_URL=http://your-target-service.com
   PORT=3000
   ```

Note: The `.env` file is ignored by Git for security. Use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

For deployment platforms like render.com, configure these environment variables in your deployment platform's dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Start the Proxy Server**:

    You can start the server using either of the following commands:

   - Using npm:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   - Directly with Node.js:

     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```

   Ensure that the `start` script in your `package.json` is correctly configured if you choose to use `npm start`.

2. **Access the Proxy**:

    Direct your client applications to the proxy server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to have requests forwarded to the target service.
