# Node.js Reverse Proxy Service

This lightweight Node.js application functions as a reverse proxy, serving as the public-facing interface to route requests to a target service. It effectively masks the target service's IP, aiding in bypassing IP-based restrictions.

## Features

- **Efficient Request Routing**: Forwards incoming HTTP requests to the designated backend service.
- **IP Obfuscation**: Conceals the actual IP address of the target service, enhancing accessibility.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, ensuring swift and reliable performance.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brkcoc02/reverse-proxy-service.git
